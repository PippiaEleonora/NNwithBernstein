# NNwithBernstein
In this work, we intend to approximate a feedforward Neural Network using the Bernstein coefficients

## Download
Open your terminal, navigate to your desired directory and write:

``git clone https://github.com/PippiaEleonora/NNwithBernstein.git``

## Installation
1. Extract the ZIP file (or clone the git repository) somewhere you can easily reach it.
    - to clone open your terminal, navigate to your desired directory and write:
    ``git clone https://github.com/PippiaEleonora/NNwithBernstein.git``
2. Add the `src/` folder to your path in MATLAB: e.g. 
    - using the "Set Path" dialog in MATLAB, or 
    - by running the `startup` script.
        ```matlab
        startup
        ```

The code is written in MATLAB and it makes use of Symbolic Toolbox. No special installation is required. 

The folder src/polytopes_2018_10_04_v1 contains the functions of Matt J., please visit his page on
